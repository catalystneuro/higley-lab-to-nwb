    - name: DFFOnePhotonSeriesBlue
      description: Processed Imaging data from Green channel recorded with Blue excitation. Raw images are detrended and baseline corrected to calculate DF/F images. Specifically, for each pixel, a 100th-order fir filter with 0.001-Hz frequency cutoff was applied to extract the low-pass-filtered signal. This low-pass signal was used as baseline (F0), and DF/F for each pixel was calculated as (F − F0)/F0, where F is the raw unfiltered signal.
