  Device:
    - name: TwoPhotonMicroscope
      description: MOM microscope (Sutter Instruments) coupled to a 16x, 0.8 NA objective (Nikon). Excitation was driven by a Titanium-Sapphire Laser (Mai-Tai eHP DeepSee, Spectra-Physics).
      manufacturer: Sutter Instruments
    - name: OnePhotonMicroscope
      description: Zeiss Axiozoom with a 1x, 0.25 NA objective with a 56 mm working distance. Epifluorescent excitation was provided by an LED bank (Spectra X Light Engine, Lumencor). To image through the implanted prism, a long-working distance objective (20x, 0.4 NA, Mitutoyo) was used.
