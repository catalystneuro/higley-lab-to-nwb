Ophys:
  Device:
    - name: TwoPhotonMicroscope
      description: MOM microscope (Sutter Instruments) coupled to a 16x, 0.8 NA objective (Nikon). Excitation was driven by a Titanium-Sapphire Laser (Mai-Tai eHP DeepSee, Spectra-Physics).
      manufacturer: Sutter Instruments
    - name: OnePhotonMicroscope
      description: Zeiss Axiozoom with a 1x, 0.25 NA objective with a 56 mm working distance. Epifluorescent excitation was provided by an LED bank (Spectra X Light Engine, Lumencor). To image through the implanted prism, a long-working distance objective (20x, 0.4 NA, Mitutoyo) was used.
      manufacturer: Zeiss
  TwoPhotonSeries:
    - name: TwoPhotonSeries
      description: Imaging data from Green channel recorded with 2p microscope. Images were acquired at 512x512 resolution using a galvo-resonant scan system controlled by ScanImage software (Vidrio).

    - name: OnePhotonSeriesIsosbestic
      description: Imaging data recorded with 1p microscope for isosbestic control. Images were acquired at 576x576 resolution after 45x pixel binning with 20ms exposure.

      unit: n.a.
    - name: DffOnePhotonSeries
      description: Processed imaging data from Green channel recorded with 1p microscope. Raw images are detrended and baseline corrected to calculate DF/F images. Specifically, for each pixel, a 100th-order fir filter with 0.001-Hz frequency cutoff was applied to extract the low-pass-filtered signal. This low-pass signal was used as baseline (F0), and DF/F for each pixel was calculated as (F − F0)/F0, where F is the raw unfiltered signal.
